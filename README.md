Assignment Questions

Easy 1: Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
Time complexity : O(n)

Easy 2: Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a 
height-balanced binary search tree.
Time Complexity : O(n)

Easy 3 : Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
Time Complexity : O(n^2)

Medium 1 : Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
Time Complexity : O(n)

Medium 2 : Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
Time Complexity : O(n)

Medium 3 : Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.
Time Complexity : O(m*n)  ( m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the input matrix.)

Hard 1 : Return the max sliding window.
You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
Time Complexity :  O(n) ( where n is the length of the input array )

Hard 2 : You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
Time Complexity : O(n^2)  ( where n is the length of the input string )

Hard 3 : Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
Time Complexity : O(n*m) ( where n is the input integer and m is the number of digits in the largest number in the range from 1 to n. )
